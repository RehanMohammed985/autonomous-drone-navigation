# Autonomous Drone Navigation System

An AI-powered drone navigation framework built for real-time obstacle avoidance and path planning using deep reinforcement learning, computer vision, and SLAM-based state estimation. Designed for use in both simulation (AirSim) and deployment on small drones powered by Jetson Nano or Raspberry Pi + Realsense.

## 🧠 System Overview

- **Perception**: YOLOv8 + depth estimation for obstacle detection.
- **Localization**: ORB-SLAM2 or RTAB-Map for visual-inertial odometry.
- **Control**: DRL policy trained with PPO via Stable Baselines3.
- **Fallback Planner**: Grid-based A* for fail-safe navigation.
- **Simulator**: AirSim API for flight data and training episodes.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, ROS2, Stable Baselines3, AirSim
- Optional deployment on PX4 autopilot via MAVROS
